## Submission folders

**comp_part 1:** Is a simple REST-API that outputs list data from the [test API](https://sv-reqres.now.sh/).

**comp_part 2:** Builds upon part 1 and allows to user to filter data  from the API based on the following:
 - All
 - Listings
 - Events
 - Offers

**comp_part 3:** Builds upon to part 2, the user is able to page through results from the API on pre-created grid layouts. When the user gets to the last page, clicking the next button brings the user back to the first page. Similarly, clicking the previous button when on the first page of the list takes the user to the last page.

**comp_part 4:** Builds upon part 3, this component randomizes the items that are displayed on the page on the loading of a new page or when a different filter is chosen.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Simpleview for the opportunity to demonstrate my abilities as a developer. I hope hear back soon from the hiring team.
